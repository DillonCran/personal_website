    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Born and raised in the Greater Toronto Area, I started my early career out
      as an accountant. As I aged however I realized that I should be focusing
      on what I love doing instead of what I thought would be profitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now at the age of 30 I find myself working closer to what I love, building
      a life with my wife and four kids, and maintaining decent physical
      fitness. Finding harmony is balancing my life around these.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my heart I am a hard working problem solver that loves to learn. No
      matter how big a project, it can always be broken down into manageable
      tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also a big animal lover, and try to do my part in keeping my local
      neighbourhood clean.

      <p>
        Like my hobbies, I try to branch my professional development into areas

        these aspects.
