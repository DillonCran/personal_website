    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Born and raised in the Greater Toronto Area, I started my early career out as an accountant.  As I aged however I realized that I should be focusing on what I love doing instead of what I thought would be profitable.</p>
    <p>Now at the age of 30 I find myself working closer to what I love, building a life with my wife and four kids, and maintaining decent physical fitness.  Finding harmony is balancing my life around these.</p>
    <p>In my heart I am a hard working problem solver that loves to learn.  No matter how big a project, it can always be broken down into manageable tasks.</p>
    <p>I am also a big animal lover, and try to do my part in keeping my local neighbourhood clean.</p>
