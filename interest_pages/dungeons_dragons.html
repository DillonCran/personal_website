    <h1>TTRPG (Worldbuilding in general)</h1>
    <p>In my spare time I like to host D&D games for my friends and family set in custom homebrew worlds.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Map making</li>
      <li>homebrew content</li>
      <li>current campaign</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Map Making</h3>

    <p>The process of mapmaking is incredibly important and is my first step when working on a new worldbuilding project.</p>
    <p>Outline steps for mapmaking here</p>

    <h3>Homebrew Content</h3>
    <p>While mapmaking itself is homebrew by nature, I like to try and fill the world the map represents with things.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Items</li>
      <li>characters</li>
      <li>loctions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Blackwind Campaign</h3>
    <p>Outline the story of my current campaign and how the map/content came to be.</p>
