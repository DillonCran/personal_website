    <h1>Fitness!</h1>
    <p>Fitness to me has two main aspects to it.  General physical fitness as well as the practical sport.</p>

    <h3>General fitness</h3>
    <p>I try and keep to a decently strict workout regiment, though I am more laxed about diet despite 80% of fitness happening in the kitchen.</p>

    <h3>Fencing</h3>
    <p>I love most contact sports, growing up watching martial arts films really instilled a deep respect for the sport in me.</p>
