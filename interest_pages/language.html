    <h1>Languages</h1>
    <p>While I seem to have a natural talent for learning, languages are very hard to really learn!</p>

    <h3>Japanese</h3>
    <p>My main language focus!</p>
    <p>I know maybe 1000 words, which is barely enough to string along a sentince</p>
    <p>5000 is about what is needed to know to be decently knowledgable</p>
    <p>Explain the JLPT N5 - N1</p>

    <h3>French</h3>
    <p>Learning French is school really turned me away from the language</p>
    <p>However as an adult looking back onto French I realize what I didnt like about the language was how it was taught</p>
    <p>While French is not my current priority, in the coming years as my kids get older I will be learning French along with them to encourage their growth in ways I know it is lacking within school</p>
